Exploring / remaking TidalCycles in SuperCollider

First steps: Scheduling and un-scheduling a full tidal cycle pattern while it is running, at any point.

Use absolute time with a Routine (fork).
Not TempoClock.

Figure out how to replace unscheduled events with new ones, and continue with scheduling the next due event during the cycle, when replacing the entire pattern.

For this,

- use absolute time: Clock.seconds.
- calculate the absolute time of all events in the pattern.
- Find the next event, i.e. the next event whose absolute time is greater than Clock.seconds.
- Schedule the next event at event.abstime - Clock.seconds
- continue with scheduling all events till end of cycle

Using a class to implement this.
